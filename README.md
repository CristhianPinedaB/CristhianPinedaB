## About ::

👩🏽‍🎓| Hello, I am Cristhian and recently took a turn in my career to become a Fullstack Developer, Why?, I have always loved technology, and how it impacts people's lives. Being such a powerful tool, I consider that democratizing technology is everyone's task, and I am very passionate about being able to contribute to this process. 

👩🏽‍💻| Thus, I entered Henry's Fullstack Development bootcamp, and learned the main technologies used in web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, Express, React, Redux, SQL, Sequelize, among others) creating various projects from scratch.

🧩In addition, thanks to the experience gained in international business they helped me develop skills such as empathy, adaptability, teamwork, leadership, effective communication, negotiation, and time management.
